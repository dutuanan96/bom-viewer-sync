# BOM Viewer / PDM Context

AI debugging entrypoint: read `AI_DEBUG_GUIDE.md` first. It is self-contained; the remaining context files provide current integration state and handoff detail.

## Canonical Source And Build

- Canonical project root: `work/remote-bom-viewer-sync/bom-viewer-sync/`; editable application source lives in `src/`.
- Current integration branch: `main`.
- PR #1 (`codex/product-bom-revisions` -> `main`) was squash-merged on 2026-07-14 as `72debab`.
- Build command: `npm run build`; complete repository gate: `npm run check`.
- Generated files: `admin.html`, `app-admin.js`, `styles.css`, and `viewer.html`.
- Never edit generated files directly. Edit source or build scripts, then rebuild.
- Current generated build ID on integrated `main`: `238032e12d0f`.

## Product Revision And Effectivity Model

- `currentRevision` is the latest design revision; `effectiveRevision` is the single revision currently used in production.
- Creating a revision from a released product creates a Draft and preserves the previous BOM as an immutable snapshot.
- Creating Draft `V3.1` does not automatically release it and does not move effectivity away from released `V3`.
- Releasing the clean latest Draft requires a reason, makes it the sole effective revision, and leaves earlier revisions released but non-current.
- Released and historical revisions are read-only. A new revision may be created from the current released revision.
- Transition metadata and events must preserve the source revision and release history.

The main domain owner is `src/domain/revisions.js`; orchestration is in `src/application.js`, and the BOM selectors are rendered by `src/ui/bom-view.js`.

## Material Master 2D/3D Editing

- Material text fields, `drawings` and `models3d` are edited through one isolated `state.materialDraft`.
- Add/Delete/Open operate on the draft. Back, material switch and module switch discard it; silent refresh cannot replace an active draft.
- Existing asset objects are spread before updating `name` and `url`, preserving `path`, `sourceUrl`, `driveId`, `previewUrl` and unknown metadata.
- 3D rows render the edited `url` before stale `previewUrl`; successful save synchronizes `previewUrl = url` for `<model-viewer>`.
- 2D requires HTTPS Drive/PDF; 3D requires a direct HTTPS GLB/GLTF URL. Empty, invalid and duplicate URLs block local save through i18n errors.
- Save Material updates local payload only. Save to GitHub remains a separate explicit action using the current remote payload and SHA.

## Inactive Contents Asset Storage Experiment

Branch `codex/github-contents-assets` adds a standalone infrastructure adapter for create-only binary writes to public repository `dutuanan96/bom-viewer-assets`. Paths contain the full SHA-256 content hash, files are limited to 20,000,000 bytes, and Viewer URLs are pinned to the full asset-repository commit SHA on jsDelivr. Real PDF and GLB smoke passed MIME, inline PDF, CORS and `<model-viewer>` loading. The adapter is not connected to Admin, Viewer or Material Draft; `data.js`, asset metadata, `outputs/`, and Desktop remain unchanged. Phase B requires separate approval.

## Notification Diff Coverage

`src/features/notifications.js` now reports product additions, material additions/deletions/field edits and BOM additions/deletions/quantity changes. BOM child resolution must prefer `childMaterialId` and fall back to `materialId`; quantity serialization must use nullish fallback so numeric zero is preserved.

## Current Synchronization State

| Surface | State | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical `main` checkout | Integrated implementation, current data and generated artifacts | Source of truth |
| Outer `outputs/` runtime artifacts | Rebuilt from integrated `main` | Portable runtime mirror |
| Outer `outputs/` context documents | Current | Keep byte-identical to the canonical context documents |
| Desktop `admin.html` / `viewer.html` | Release copies synchronized from the verified integrated build | Replace only after future integrated builds pass |
| Canonical `data.js` | Current merged GitHub/main data: 646 materials, 1 notification | Do not overwrite from mirrors |
| Outer `outputs/data.js` | Older clean snapshot: 643 materials, 6 notifications | Intentional; never copy over canonical data |

The Viewer uses a cache-busted GitHub Contents API read, so remote data can be newer than the local `data.js`. Admin saves must read the current remote payload and SHA immediately before diffing and writing.

## Verified Baseline (2026-07-14)

- `npm run check`: 89/89 tests passed.
- Canonical data audit: 646 materials, 2725 BOM entries, 22 products, 1 notification, 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- Outer Material Master/revision contracts: 23/23 passed.
- Outer runtime contracts: 13/13 passed.
- Generated artifact check and JavaScript syntax check passed.
- Browser smoke verified Material Asset draft behavior and a real GLB render; manual clean-profile `file://` verification remains the final distribution check because automation blocks that protocol.

Do not treat a hard-coded test count as permanent; always report the current command output.
